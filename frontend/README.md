## Development

Create an `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

```env
VITE_BACKEND_URL=[backend url here]
```

From your terminal:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Or:

```sh
npm install
npm dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
